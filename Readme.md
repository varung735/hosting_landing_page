## About Project

This is a home page of a hosting service.
  
  - This web page consists of a simple navbar, main & footer.
  - This webpage has simple HTML properties like divs, etc.
  - It also uses linear color gradients in some backgrounds.
  - Tried to use cards in pricing sections
 

## Time Taken

It took me around 2.5 days for the project.

## Concepts learned

 - Applied flex display properties in navbar, footer & in many sections of the page.
 - Used grid display property in customer sections.
 - Got to know about cards which is easily used through bootstrap or Tailwind perhaps (created them manually using CSS in this project)
 - Used linear gradients for background colors.
